Guilty Pleasure
Elton John / Bernie Taupin

C  G  D  A  (x4)

E	      A
Hand it over, reach across the line
C	     G		     D	       A
Let's talk about it, tell me one more time
E		F	   	  G	       D
What is it you want, what'll you think you'll find
   C  G/B   B   A    G       E
Inside of this old heart of mine

E		    A
Come on out if you want to play
C	       G	     D       A
The rain went East, thunder rolled away
E		F	       G      D
Will you ever choose, are you gonna stay
     C G/B  B   A           G      E
For loving you that's the price I pay

C
Can't you tell the deal's been done
G
Won't you let me love you
C
I don't see no smoking gun
G
And I'm not here to judge you
B
What do you see when you look at me
Em	D	C
Tailor-made to measure
G/D			 D
Am I'm the love of your life my love
    C         B  A    A  G
Or just some guilty pleasure

E		 A
I roamed around looking for a clue
C	      G			D       A
Searched the world, it's what I used to do
E	 F	      G		D
Where I went and what I went through
  C  G/B  B       A       G      E
A beaten path to find my way to you

E		  A
I can't whistle, never really could
C       G                D      A
Sang a song I guess you understood
E	      F		    G         D
It's what you do when you think you should
    C G/B  B	   A	    G	    E
Surrender like you knew you always would

REPEAT CHORUS

D
Hold out or still in doubt
C	  G/D   D
What's it gonna be
Bm		     Em
Never a chance in a million years
        C		   D
Or you can't get enough of me

E A C G D A E F G D C G/B B A G E (x2)

REPEAT CHORUS

G/D			 D
Am I'm the love of your life my love
    C         B  A    A  G
Or just some guilty pleasure

C  G  D  A  (x4)
