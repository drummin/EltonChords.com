We are the Goaldiggers, we are the Goaldiggers
	  Eb			    Bb/D	F/C
And we'd like you to help us if you can
Bb/F
We would like your cooperation
F
To help our organization
   Eb					Bb/D	F/C
Provide football pitches throughout the land

Dm		      Gm
If you were a kid, oh what would you say
       Eb	 Bb/D	        F
If you found out there was just nowhere to play
Dm		    Gm
If I were a kid, oh I would feel abused
       Eb     Bb/D        C	      F
If the energy that I had couldn't be used

Bb/F			F
We are the Goaldiggers, we are the Goaldiggers
   Eb			        Bb/D	F/C
So help us to start the ball to roll
BB/F
Spread the word from man to man
F
Give us anything you can
Eb		       Bb/D	F/C
Help us to achieve our goal

If you were a kid, oh what would you say
If you found out there was just nowhere to play
If I were a kid, oh I would feel abused
If the energy that I had couldn’t be used.

Goaldigger, Goaldigger
EB		  Bb/D			F/C
I'm a Goaldigger, he's a Goaldigger
Bb/F	    F
Goaldigger, Goaldigger
Eb
I'm a Goaldigger ...
