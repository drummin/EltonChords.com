Ab - Eb - Bb	F# - Ab - Eb (x2)

  Bb
I know that you'll not understand this
     F#		    Ab	       Eb
And I know that I'm wasting my time
            Cm			Gm
But there's something I need to tell you
     Db		 Ab	       Eb
And something inside says it's fine

    Bb
It's maybe because of the cider
   F#	      Ab         Eb
Or maybe it's due to the snow
      Cm			   Gm
And I know that you don't feel the same way
    Db		  Ab	       Eb   F
But maybe you'll still want to know

 C
I don't have a day that's without you
 Eb
I think about where you might be
Bb/D		   F/C    Bb/D		    F/C
Things that you've done, stuff that you've said
      C			          F/C  C    F/C
But I know that you don't think about me
    C
But that's OK I understand
   Eb
If that's the way it must be
         Bb/D		     F/C
But I'll always think of you Billy
C    F/C   C
Unrequitedly

Ab - Eb - Bb	F# - Ab - Eb

  Bb
I know that I shouldn't have told you
   F#	     Ab		Eb
No Michael, please it's OK
    Cm		       Gm
You won't tell anyone else then
    Db		  Ab      Eb
Who am I going to tell anyway

   Bb
It must be because of the cider
    F#		  Ab           Eb
No, I recon it's 'cause of the snow
          Cm			 Gm
But we'll both have to keep it a secret
      Db       Ab	Eb    F
Don't worry no one will know

   C
But I don't have a day that's without you
   	   Eb
Thinking about where you might be
Bb/D		  F/C   b7D		 F/C
Things that you'll do, stuff that you'll say
      C			      F/C C    F/C
Even though you don't think about me
    C
But that's OK I understand
  Eb
If that's the way it must be
      Bb/D	      F/C
And I think about you some of the time
       C	      F/C	  C
If you promise you'll think about me

Ab		      Eb
Don't worry please, I understand
Bb			F
We all want things that we can't have
Ab			Eb     BB
And I still love you in my own way
           F	            G
But that's OK, yeah that's OK

I don't have a day that's without you
I think about where you might be
Things that you've done, stuff that you've said
But I know that you don't think about me
But that's OK I understand
If that's the way it must be
But I'll always think of you Billy
Unrequitedly

         Bb/D		     F/C
But I'll always think of you Billy

Unrequitedly
