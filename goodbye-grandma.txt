F#		 Bb
Goodbye Grandma, sleep well tonight
Ebm	 C#		  B
Dream of all your younger days
Abm			     C#
Way before time had left you sad
		     B	 F#
And store yourself awa - y

F#
'Cause I remember you
Bb		   Ebm		C#	B
Just as you always used to be
Abm		      C#
Before time had taken toll
	      B		F#
And stole you away from me

     Bm				F#
And I wish I could stop time tonight
    Bm			  F#
And hold the whole world still
    Ebm		    Abm
And keep you here forever
       C#
To be mine

      Bm		  F#
And I wish the world was different
            Bm		   F#
And I could hold you in my arms
      Ebm	      Abm
And I keep you here forever
	 C#
For all time

      F#	      Bb
'Cause Grandma, I can sail the seven seas
	Ebm    C#	     B
I could take a rocket to the moon
		Abm
But everywhere I go
		   C#
You would be there too
		 B	    F#
And I'd be right there with you

Bm	      F#
Sleep well tonight
Bm	      F#
Sleep well tonight
