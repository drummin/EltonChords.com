Just An Ordinary Man

INTRO
Eb		Abmaj7		Eb		Abmaj7

VERSE 1	
Eb		        Abmaj7
      Counting ships on the sea
Eb		            Abmaj7
      Collecting numbers in the breeze
   Eb         Bbsus   G/B  Cm	       	Eb/Bb
Of every lazy wave of water on the shore
   Ab6					  Eb/Bb	Bb
In summer sky, what man could ask for more

VERSE 2	
Eb	      Abmaj7
      Digging holes in the sand
Eb		        Abmaj7
      In search of some forgotten land
Eb                   Bbsus  G/B   Cm	       Eb/Bb
      Just in case I may discover something there
        Ab6					                Eb/Bb	  Bb7
I could tell a busy world, but I don't think a busy world would care

CHORUS
Ab/Eb
      For I'm just a man
Fm/D
      An ordinary man
Cm                        Cm/Bb      Ab
      With a hand full of sand and a dream
                  Eb/G
Strange as it may seem
Ab                    Eb
      I'm an ordinary man
Bb7
      That's all I am

      I’m still collecting numbers in the breeze
Eb             Bbsus   G/B  Cm	       Ebmaj7/Bb
 Of every lazy wave of water on the shore

In summer sky, what man could ask for more
