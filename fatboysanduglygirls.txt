Am F G C (x2)

C
Fat boys cry when ugly girls sing
Am				    F
About the way the world would be if they were thin
    C
And ugly girls turn their heads when fat boys laugh
Am				     F
About the handsome kid next door who broke their heart
    G
Who broke their heart
F
Broke their heart

    C
And fat boys lie when ugly girls ask
Am						 F
About the size an apple pie looks through a magnifying glass
    C
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
Am						 F
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
	      G
Beauty's only skin deep
F
Skin deep

G
But it's the fat boy's world for an ugly girl
			  F	  C
And ugly girls love that fat boy joy
G
Who needs the worries of a perfect world
				F	   C
Hear the early birds make that spring time come
	F		 G		  C		Am
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
	F		 G		  C		Am
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl

Fat boys dance when ugly girls shout
That a waltz is not the dance for the boy who's stout
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep

repeat chorus
