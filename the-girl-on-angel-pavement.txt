Gm

	      F           Eb
Can you see me walking behind you
         Cm	  Am         D	   D7
Could you imagine holding my hand
     Gm		A		Dm
But I doubt it, you don't even know me
	Eb/Bb	       Am7	   D7
Though I stood in your shadow for years

	Gm	    F		  Eb
From my window each day I see her go by
      Cm	    Am		   D    D7
And my love for her I just try to hide
	 Gm         A			 Dm
It's not right that I should spend such lonely nights
	Eb/Bb			   F  G
When the girl on Angel pavement oh oh oh 


Well the girl on Angel Pavement
        E7
I would give my very world
    Am					D		D7
And though she'll never know how much I love her so
	G
For the girl on Angel Pavement
	E7
I would give my very world
    Am					D
And though she'll never know how much I love her so
    Gm			Am7		 D7
But I can only sit and watch her walking by

Am7	D7

Am	     G		     F
All my empty days I pass the time away
Dm		Bm		       E	E7
Thinking of the things that could have been
       Am	B		Em
Hoping that one day I wouldn't have to be
  F/C					  G  A
Waiting for the girl on Angel Pavement oh oh oh 


Well the girl on Angel Pavement
        F#7
I would give my very world
    Bm					E		E7
And though she'll never know how much I love her so
	A
For the girl on Angel Pavement
	F#7
I would give my very world
    Bm					E
And though she'll never know how much I love her so
    Am			Bm7		 E7
But I can only sit and watch her walking by
