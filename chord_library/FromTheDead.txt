From the Dead (Finale)
from the musical Lestat (2005)
Elton John/Bernie Taupin

Db		  Ebm		Ab	      Bbm
Before today this body bore the burden of his kind
    Gb			Ab		Bbm		  Abm
The quest to learn why I was made, the endless search for signs
	Ebm		Bb			B		   Ebm
Through all my rage and tender stages, through decades drenched in blood
    F		    Bbm		    Gb		    Ab
The source of our existence came between the ones I loved

   Db		    Ebm		   Ab		  Bbm
The __ spring of our live is me, a power beyond belief
    Gb		   Ab		    Bbm		      Abm
She feeds me understanding and overwhelming sense of peace
     Ebm		    Bb			B		Ebm
From what I've learned I've come to terms with bonds of brotherhood
    F		   Bbm	      Gb	      Ab
I'm seeing clearly now when I never thought I could

   Bbm			    C
I'll never make another, to satisfy desire
     F			  Bbm
Blame God for family only orchestrates the fire
  G				Cm
I know to slave the innocent is wrong
    F				     Bb
And from the dead this new awakening comes
    
    Ab       Eb					Cm
And from the dead I feel the strength I've never known
  Ab				    Bb
A thrill that fills my heart helping me to stand alone
   Ab	      Eb				Cm
And from the dead their ancient eyes watch over me
		Ab		   Bb		    Eb
It seems from death this tortured heart is finally free

    Ab       Eb					Cm
And from the dead there comes a healing and a hope
      Ab                            Bb
Like music on the wind, the perfect pitching of a note
    Ab        Eb                                 Cm
And from the dead the cold pale moon begins to bleed
              Ab		  Bb		    Eb
It seems from death I sense this night was made for me

 Bbm			   C
I only take what's evil to satiate my thirst
F			      Bbm
Prey on those who murder, I'll only drain the worst
  G				Cm
I know to slay the innocent is wrong
   F					Bb
And from the dead this new awakening comes

(repeat chorus)
		Ab		   Bb		    Eb
It seems from death I sense this night was made for me
