Gauguin Gone Hollywood
Bonus track from the Target exclusive edition
Elton John-Bernie Taupin

G	Em	Am	D	Em	D

   G		   Em    	  Am	    D
He talks a lot but never talks to anyone at all
   G			Em            Am	     D  
He shakes his fists at busses and old posters on the walls
  C					 G/D  D   Em
He knows someone who knew something about J.  F.  K.
        A  				    D
But his friends are just the shadows in the halls and alleyways

    G		     Em		   Am		  D
The rumbling frozen pipes whisper secrets in the night
      G  		   Em		    Am		    D
In the coffee grounds, his fingers sketch a portrait of his wife
   C				  G/D	      D           Em
She knew the legal eagle when his wings swept through the stars
   A				     D
Before he shut the furnace down and sealed away his heart

    Eb		  Ab	      Bb
It's Gauguin gone Hollywood again
	    Cm	    Ab		   Bb
A sleeping giant inside a rabbit's skin
          G		   Cm
Tahitian doors beyond the painted veil
        D	      G
Another simple mind adrift
     Ab		   Bb		F - C
Like Gauguin going Hollywood again

Eb - Bb		F - C		Eb - Bb

   G		      Em	      Am	     D
The day lacks color, days are duller than a butter knife
 G	     Em			   Am		     D
Rusty water running through hands out of touch with life
 C				  G/D    D       Em
A man of independent means, he'd have us all believe
 A				    D
A soul who throws his wings away before he goes to sleep

(repeat chorus)

Eb - Bb		F - C		Eb - Bb

  F           C/E 	   G		     Am
If only for a moment, the dead weight were alive
  F		C/E		G		Am
An invitation for the flame to shine a light inside
Fm	      C		Fm	      C
Illuminating darkness, giving him release
     F		    C/E		    F		   G
Then someday in his trash can we'll find a masterpiece

(repeat chorus)

     Ab		   Bb		F - C
Like Gauguin going Hollywood again

Eb - Bb		F - C		Eb - Bb		F -C
