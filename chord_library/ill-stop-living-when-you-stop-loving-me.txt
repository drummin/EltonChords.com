I’ll Stop Living When You Stop Loving Me 
Elton John / Bernie Taupin
piano  demo (1968)

G - Bm/F# - C - D

        Em7
Have you ever seen a bluebird smile
   Bm7
Or watched a leaf cry for a while
         G	    D/F#      Em
Have you ever heard someone before
      Am7		 D
Kinda choke walk out the door

Em7
That's how it feels to be left alone
    Bm7
Without a love to call your own
	 G	  D/F#    Em
Breaking up isn't easy to do
	    Am7		    D		 G/D
It's like a tall brick wall falling in on you

	       Dm	    E7		Am
I know you can find someone richer than me
	      C	       Am/C	 D     G/D
But I'll stop living if you stop loving me
	 Em		     C
Baby you know that I'll stop living
     Am/C     D      G
When you stop loving me

G - Bm/F# - C - D

   Em7
The sun is someone that stood in the sky
        Bm7
And I'd give you the sun if I could reach that high
		 G	    D/F#	 Em
I'd give you the moon, the stars and the sea
   Am7		      D			 G/D
As long as you never think of setting me free

repeat  chorus

   Em
So let us walk along the tide line
          Am
'Cause whatever your time's my time
    Bm7
And everything is gonna work out fine
  C				   D
I know in the end, you're staying mine

repeat chorus

	 Em		     C
Baby you know that I'll stop living
     Am/C     D      G
When you stop loving me
	 Em		     C
Baby you know that I'll stop living
     Am/C     D      G
When you stop loving me

G - Bm/F# - C - D - G
