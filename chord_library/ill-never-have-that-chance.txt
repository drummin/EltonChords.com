I’ll Never Have That Chance
Elton John / Bernie Taupin
from the ”Lestat” musical (2005)

Ab - G - G7 - C (x2)

Eb
I have spent so many years
   Ab
In fancy lace and beaded gowns
Bb			     Ab
I have set my hair a hundred ways
			 Eb
My face I painted up and powdered down

     G/
This body bears a telling tale
     Cm
They pinch my cheek and wish me well
    Ab
For all their patronizing smiles
     Bb
This frame remains a prison cell

    Eb
They look at me and what they see
   Ab
Is one more painted china doll
 Bb
A sweet and cuddled dawdler with
  Ab				    Eb
A painted fan, a sweet treat, and a parasol

Fm
Inside of me there lives someone
Bb/F
Who could have been somebody's wife
Fm
Could have seen their children grow
Bb/F
Could have had a normal life
    G7
Who could have fiercely loved a man
    Cm
And felt his kisses deep and moist
    A
Instead I get this kiss of death
D
And in this I have no choice

G
Imagine walking down the aisle
Bm
I'll never have that chance
  F
A wedding dress of virgin white
    C
The very best from France
  G
A cottage in the country
    Bm
The pleasures of romance
F
Sunlight laying on my skin
     C
I'll never have that chance
   G        Ab    G     G7   C
Oh no, I'll never have that chance

Ab - G - G7 - C

     Eb
They glide around society swans
     Ab
With slim long necks and perfect breasts
   Bb
While I remain the frozen child
  Ab				 Eb
A baby bird without the wings to leave her nest

     G7
This body bears a telling tale
     Cm
They pinch my cheek and wish me well
    Ab
For all their patronizing smiles
     Bb
This frame remains a prison cell

    Eb
The mirror with its cruel laugh
    Ab
Reflects this ageless face of mine
   Bb
In taunting ways as if to say
   Ab				     Eb
A child who is not something you can leave behind

Fm
Inside of me there lives someone
Bb/F
Who never felt a mother's love
Fm
Who could have heard the bells on Sunday
Bb/F
Pealing in the church of God
    G7
Who would have loved a rainy day
    Cm
And never had to feel the fire
    A
Instead I hunger for the vein
     D
And hoard the life-force I desire

G
Pleasures of fine wine and dining
Bm
I'll never have that chance
    F
The taste of chocolate and champagne
    C
The very best from France
   G
The arching of a rainbow
   Bm
The way the colours dance
   F
The miracle of giving birth
C
I'll never have that chance

Imaging walking down the aisle
I'll never have that chance
A wedding dress of virgin white
The very best from France
A cottage in the country
The pleasures of romance
Sunlight laying on my skin
I'll never have that chance
Oh no, I'll never have that chance

     Ab    G     G7    C
I'll never have that chance
