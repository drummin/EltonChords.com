C - C - C - C

      C
Oh the jokes were never hard to tell
         A/C#
Threw my spare change in the wishing well
    Dm
The dream alone is always in your hand
   Fm				G
If that don’t fill the boy and build the man

 C
A heart has many secrets, so I'm told
           A/Cà
Through the years, a theory can grow cold
    Dm
I'm up to be the king, it’s gotten clear
    Fm			       G
The voice inside my head's the one I hear

        Db
Singing I'm gonna love me again
      Ebm
Check in on my very best friend
         Ab
Find the wind to fill my sails
      Db
Rise above the broken rails
  Bbm			 Db/Ab
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
    Gb
I'm free and don't you know
    Ebm
No clown to claim he used to know me then
    F
I'm free and don't you know
    Ebm       Gb        Ab        Db
And oh oh oh, I'm gonna love me again

   C
The golden age was somehow bittersweet
	    A/C#
But now the past lies sleeping in the deep
    Dm
The peaceful days that followed hollow nights
  Fm				G
A kiss or touch could feel like kryptonite

	   C
Praise the saints that hung up on my wall
    A/C#
For trust is love and love is after all
  Dm
A whispered word emerging from a tale
    Fm			     G
My wake-up call to claim the cursed spell

repeat chorus

C - A/C# - Dm - Fm - G

repeat chorus

   Ebm
And oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
          Gb        Ab       Db     
Oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again
