Fm - Db x4

Fm			      C7                     Fm7
Here I stand on the hill overlooking the land I was born in
                Bb
It's the early morning
     Db
The rain is still falling
		              C
And coming from yesterday's storms

Fm			    C7
Once it was bright and the moon shone each night
    Fm                         Fm7                         Db
But now it has gone with the streams of the troubles I've seen
Bb
Where have I been
Db
What have I seen
Fm		     Cm
What is exactly the matter with
Db         Bbm         Fm
One time, sometime or never


So thunder keep crashing
     C7				 Fm7
And lashing the wind through my hair
      Bb                   Dc          			   F
And blowing a hole in the place where my soul might have been

      A		        D
So I sit in my mill on top of the hill
     Bm                             E
The sails have stopped turning and time has stood still
     A			  E        A-E
Can somebody tell me the date
    E/D           A/C#      Eb7
And what day it's been

Bb
Where have I been
Db
What have I seen
Fm                  Cm
what is exactly the matter with
Db        Bbm         Fm
One time, sometime or never

   Cm
So all day alone with my head in my knees
       Db           Eb            F
And my malt wine to make me feel high
Cm
You went such a long time ago
   Db     Eb           F
Oh God I wish I could die


Once it was bright and the moon shone each night
But now it has gone with the streams of the troubles I've seen
Where have I been
What have I seen
What is exactly the matter with
One time, sometime or never
Db        Bbm          Fm
One time, sometime or never
