Dm – Bb – F – C (x2)

Dm			       Gm	   Dm
Don't chastise me, I'm a child acting as a child does
				     Gm		     Dm
You blind me with lifeless dolls when what I want is blood
   Bb					      F
You took me from the streets to complete this union
Gm				A7
Do you expect some little saint kneeling for communion
       Dm   Bb      F C	  A/C#
I want more, I want more

Dm			    Gm		   Dm
Look at you, you disapprove like two fussy mothers
			     Gm          Dm
Who are you to criticize the habits of another
Bb			      F
Did I rock the family boat by dining on the help
Gm				     A7
Aren't I just the little beast, well I can't stop myself
       Dm	    Bb		 F  C
I want more, I want more, I want more
A/C#   Dm   Bb      F  C   A/C#
I want more, I want more

Dm		   Bb		   T/C		       C
I don’t want their milk and honey, they can keep those finer ___
A/C#    Dm		     Bb			 F/C		   C
I don't need their chocolate hot and sweet, it's thick and red for me
    A7		  Dm          B7	       Em
For everyone that comes along knocking on this door
Bb		    F		     A7	    Dm Bb  F  C		A/C#
Don't blame me, it's your fault that I want mo- o- o- o-re

Dm - Bb - F - C - A/C#

Dm			      Gm	   Dm
Look at me, I'm so sweet, I'm innocent and charming
					Gm	    Dm
But all you see is some spoiled brat, a child so demanding
Bb				  F
Don't fuss so, you both know the rapture of the bite
	Gm			       A7
Is not monstrous, it's just glorious, healthy appetite
	    Dm  Bb      F  C	A/C#
And I want more, I want more

Dm				 Gm             Dm
Should I be the little miss, and while away the hours
				  Gm		Dm
I think not, I'd rather hunt than cut up paper flowers
Bb			   F
Thanks to you, things I do verge on the obscene
Gm				A7
What a pair of hypocrites, well this cat wants her cream
       Dm	    Bb		 F  C
I want more, I want more, I want more
A/C#   Dm           Bb F C	A/C#
I want more, I want mo-o-ore

Dm					  Gm		  Dm
I wander through the streets at night and find a charming couple
					Gm		Dm
Who fear that such an angel lost could find herself in trouble
    Bb				       C
They can't resist my trembling lip, my eyes so filled with tears
      A7
They rest my head upon their necks... aaah, oh dear
Dm Bb F C   A/C#    Dm   Bb      F  C   A/C# 
Mo-o -o ore, I want more, I want more

repeat chorus

      Bb  F  C  A/C#    Dm          Bb
I want mo-o-ore, I want more, I want more
       F  C  A7     Dm
I want more, I want more
