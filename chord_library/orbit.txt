I'm flying in your orbit, honey

How did I get here?
Ab
Can't listen to your grip
Bbm                             Db           Eb
I'm circulating the heaven, and what a crazy trip!
Fm                       Ab
Faster than lightning, straight to the heart
Bbm                Db          Eb
I gotta have you, come as you are

Some kind of fusion
Ab
My heart and your heart
Bbm                 Db          Eb
Romantic illusion, lighting up sparks
Fm                          Ab
It's more than beauty, it's more than life itself
Bbm                     Db             Eb
Never been lonely, it's you and no one else

And I hope I never come down, down, down
