          E/G#     Am
Indulge me if you will my friends
    F       G       Am
For I've a tale to spin
   Dm               Am
Of all the vampires on this earth
   B7         E
Of my unholy kin
Am       E/G#    Am
I am the oldest one by far
 F     G      Am
Marius is my name
    Dm            Am
When I was born it was the time
    B7            E
The Roman empire reigned
    Dm             Am
When he was born it was the time
    B7            E
the Roman empire reigned

C - G - F - E - Am

             E/G#    Am
And like you mortals as you age
    F       G     Am
The weaker you become
    Dm              Am
For us is quite the opposite
    B7                  E
The years just make us strong
    Am       E/G#    Am
But like you we feel pain and loss
     F      G         Am
And suffer heartbreak too
   Dm          Am
We ponder our existence
       B7              E
In the same way as you do
   Dm          Am
We ponder our existence
       B7               E
In the same way as you do

C - G - F - E - Am

              E/G#    Am
In the myth of your creation
             F     G        Am
There's poor Adam and sweet Eve
    Dm           Am
Temptation and a serpent
        B7             E
And the devil's apple tree
        Am    E/G#   Am
We have Enkil and Akasha
    F        G        Am
An Egyptian king and queen
    Dm            Am
The mother and the father
      B7               E
Of we pale and bloody fiends
    Dm             Am
The mother and the father
      B7               E
Of we pale and bloody fiends

 Dm             Am
Marius tell us more
 B7             E
Marius tell us more
 Dm            Am
Tell us more, tell us more
 B7      E7      Am     Dm - Am
Marius, tell us more

Dm - A - Dm - A - Dm

       Bb                           Dm
Four thousand years ago before the pyramids were built
Gm                           F         C
Enkil and Akasha ruled with wise benevolence
    Bb                           Dm
A splendor of Egyptian life was prosperous and good
              Gm		    A7
But in their kingdom enemies were present
    Bb				 Dm
And so it happened that a demon came in to the town
            Gm                           F    C
And took a liking to the home of some unfortunate
      Bb                           Dm
Who pleaded to wise Enkil for his council and advise
            Gm                  A7
Before his home this demon desecrated
     Eb                           Bb/D
The king in all the faith decided to engage the ghoul
    Cm                               F
In hopes his evil ways by chance he might dissuade
     Eb                               Bb/D
The queen would not allow her king to face this deed alone
             Cm                         D7
And in her choice the hand of fate was played
     Bbm              F           Fm         Eb
The demon tossed the furniture, malevolence abounded
    F#                 Db                Ab                  C
And while they pleaded to be heard they found themselves surrounded
   Bbm           F            Fm                  Eb
Assassins of the enemy, their collective knifes gleaming
 F#                     Db             Ab               C
Hacked and stabbed the royal pair and left the bodies bleeding

Dm - A - Dm - A - Dm

    Bb                            Dm
As they lay dying on the ground a poltergeist did swoop
            Gm					F    C
And entered in the wounds of their illustrious monarchy
       Bb                      Dm
Their reanimated bodies bore a terrifying glow
  Gm                              A7
Alive to them but dead to you and me
     Eb                                  Bb/D
The demon in their veins, they gained a supernatural power
    Cm				      F
But one that left them sorely lacking human traits
    Eb                            Bb/D
No longer to partake of food and drink or bear a child
       Cm                        D7
Their hunger only blood could satiate
     Bbm                  F                 Fm             Eb
They could not face the blazing sun, its magnificence was deadly
         F#                Db                Ab                C
But the power of gods and eternal life is a simply wonderful medley
        Bbm           F                 Fm          Eb
In the sands of Egypt to this day dwell Enkil and Akasha
     D             Gm                 Eb    F          Bb/F
The rulers of the vampire race our beloved mother and father
