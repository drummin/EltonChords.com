Bb - Ab - Eb (x4)

Cm		     F
Had some good times jumping ship
     Bb            Eb
And showing up on shore
      Cm               F
Just pocket change to get us by
   Bb                      Bb7
A little bit of grease to help us slide
 Eb                   F
Give us an inch we'd take a mile
       Gm      F       Eb	C/E-F
And squeeze under the door

 Cm		       F
Caught some big ones, reeled 'em in
     Bb             Eb
And hung 'em out to dry
      Cm             F
From little fish to bigger things
   Bb              Bb7
A welcome push, an empty swing
 Eb                     F    
Given the chance we'd start to sing
     Gm        F       Eb     C/E-F
And watch the world go by

           Bb
And I've tried to take my time
            Cm
To get back up, hold on and climb
         F
Into the arms you'll always find me
                 Bb     Ab-Eb
In England and America
       Bb
Feels good to hold, to not let go
      Cm
This safety net still hangs below
          F
And if I fall it's good to know
                      Bb       Ab-Eb  Bb-Ab-Eb
There's England and America

  Cm                   F
Showed our roots from time to time
    Bb            Eb
And used it to ignite
     Cm             F
Our wilder side to get us through
    Bb                Bb7
To push and pull and come unglued
   Eb               F
A mixture of red, white and blues
    Gm           F         Eb    C/E-F
Had run right through our life
