C . Am . F - Dm - G

 C
I wake up and I look at the clock
        Am
In the middle of the night my heart stops
       F
When I see you in the moonlight
  Dm		   G
I know why I'm in love

C
Peace will come I promise you
  Am
I wish you success in all you do
	    F
And when I think about the rest
  Dm		   G
I know why I'm in love

     Am
It's hard to find the kind of thing
       Dm
You've searched for all your life
G
Someone bright and crazy
	Em
With a little soul inside
    F
And looking at you fast asleep
Dm		    G
I thank the stars above

    Ab        EB    Bb
And what more can I say
	     Ab      Eb	      Bb
I've said it all in different ways
	    B         F#     C#       F#
The bottom line, the simple facts are true
  B	    F#     C#       F#
I know why I'm in love with you
       Abm	  	B       C#
I only hope you know I love you too

  C
I kiss you and I melt inside
	  Am
What you mean to me I can't describe
	F
And if seeing is believing
      Dm	       G
You'd know why I'm in love

Peace will come I promise you
I wish you success in all you do
And when I think about the rest
I know why I'm in love

It's hard to find the kind of thing
You've searched for all your life
Someone bright and crazy
With a little soul inside
And looking at you fast asleep
I thank the stars above

    Ab        Eb    Bb
And what more can I say
	     Ab      Eb	      Bb
I've said it all in different ways
	    B	      F#     C#       F#
The bottom line, the simple facts are true

    B         F#    C#
And what more can I say
             B	     Fà	       C#
I've said it all in different ways
           C          G	     D	       G
