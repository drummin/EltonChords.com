E-Ticket
written by E. John, E. Vedder, A. Wotman
duet with Eddie Vedder

G - Bb - C - G (x2)

G
Riding beside me, silver light lightning
Bb/f          C/G   G           
Time quickly disappears

Born out of fireworks, still looking skyward
    Bb/f     C/G  G
As darkness reappears

    Am                   D
You gotta figure it's an E-Ticket ride
 G                 C
Why else stand in line?
    Am                D
We take a ride in our E-Ticket minds
         G                    C              Am
Tell me yours, I'll tell you mine, tell you mine
D         G
E-Ticket ride

G - Bb - C - G (x2)

G
In between moments, questions and quotients
 Bb/F        C/G        G
Solved, yet still not clear

Looking for answers, we make up new dances
Bb/F         C/G             G
Ain't that enough, if that's all there is?

repeat chorus

C                 D
I've no need to pledge my faith
    G
To nothin' but time and tide
     F
And I can see the universe
       D
As the universe sees me, yeah

G - Bb - C - G (x2)

   Am                   D
You gotta figure it's an E-Ticket ride
 G                 C
Why else stand in line?
    Am                D
We take a ride in our E-Ticket minds
         G                    C   
Tell me yours, I'll tell you mine       (x2)
          Am
Tell you mine
D         G
E-Ticket ride


G - Bb - C        G    (X3)
         E-Ticket ride
Bb - C (x3)
          G
E-Ticket ride
