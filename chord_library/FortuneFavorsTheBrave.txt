Fortune Favors the Brave
Elton John-Tim Rice

C     D      Ab       Bb        C
Oh oh oh oh, fortune favors the brave
   D	  Ab       Bb        C
Oh oh oh, fortune favors the brave

C       F/C	 C		   F/C      C
We have swept to glory, Egypt's mastery expands
		F/C	 C		      F/C       C
From the Nile's northern delta to the dry dry southern lands

    F					Bb
The more we find, the more we see, the more we come to learn
Ab					  Eb
The more we explore, the more we shall return
C     D      Ab      Bb          C
Oh oh oh oh, fortune favors the brave

F			Bb/F
It's all worked out, my road is clear
Gm		  Dm
The lines of latitude extend
Bb	      C
Way beyond my wildest dreams
A	     A7	      Dm
Towards some great triumphant end
 Bb		     C
We seized the day, we turned the tide
  A		        Dm
We touched the stars, we mocked the grave
  Eb		  Cm
We moved into uncharted land
Ab       Bb        C
Fortune favors the brave

   F				      Bb
The more we find, the more we see, the more we come to learn
Ab		        Eb
The more we explore, the more we shall return

F	     Bb/F
Nothing is an accident
Gm	       Dm
We are free to have it all
Bb		C
We are what we want to be
    A	      A7      Dm
It's in ourselves to rise or fall
Bb	     C
This is easy to believe
   A		    Dm
When distant places call to me
    Eb		      Cm
It's harder from the palace yard
Ab       Bb        C
Fortune favors the free
   D      Ab      BB         C
Oh oh oh, fortune favors the young
   D      Ab       Bb        C
Oh oh oh, fortune favors the brave
