Bb - F - Gm - Eb - F (x2) while spoken

Here's a piece of advice, Billy
Piss off out of here
Start everything afresh
And don't look back
There is sod-all left for you here
You are very fookin' special
Now piss off before I start to cry

Bb                        Eb          
Once we built visions on ground we hewed
F                           Bb
We dreamt of justice and of men renewed
D                 Gm
All people equal, in all things
C                     F
We once were heroes, once were kings

    Bb                     F
But all great things must come to pass
Eb                      Bb
We know the first will soon be last
D                     Gm
And in the ground we maybe lain
       C               F
But a seed is sown to rise again

   Eb                  Bb
So we walk proudly and we walk strong
Cm                   Gm
All together we will go as one
      Eb                Bb/D  F/C Gm
The ground is empty and cold  as hell
       Cm        D             Gm
But we all go together when we go

G - C - G - Am - F - G   while spoken

You show 'em kidda
Knock them dead, Billy
Thanks, Tony
Ay, see ya sunshine

C                    F
We saw a land where wealth was shared
 G                        C
Each pain relieved, each hunger fed
 E			Am
Each man revered, each tyrant killed
 D                        G
Each soul redeemed, each life fulfilled

      C                   F
From each man's means to each his need
G                  C
We saw a time man would be freed
E                      Am
We fought for all the things we saw
     D                 G
The battle's lost but not the war

   F                   C
So we walk proudly and we walk strong
Dm                   Am
All together we will go as one
       F                C/E  G/D Am
The ground is empty and cold as hell
       Dm        E             Am
But we all go together when we go

G                        C
We will go down but our heads are proud
A                         Dm
We will go down with our voices loud
B                    Em
We will go down but come again
       Am        B7            Em
And we all go together when we go

G                 C
Ah ah ah Ah ah ah Ah ah ah
A                 Dm
Ah ah ah Ah ah ah Ah ah ah
B                 Em
Ah ah ah Ah ah ah Ah ah ah
       Am        B7            Em
And we all go together when we go

   F                   C
So we walk proudly and we walk strong
Dm                   Am
All together we will go as one
       F                C/E  G/D Am
The ground is empty and cold as hell
       Dm        E             Am
But we all go together when we go

   Ab                  Eb
So we walk proudly and we walk strong
Fm                   Cm
All together we will go as one
       Ab               Eb/G Bb/F  Cm
The ground is empty and cold  as  hell
       Fm        G             Cm
But we all go together when we go

a cappella

   Ab                  Eb
So we walk proudly and we walk strong
Fm                   Cm
All together we will go as one
       Ab               Eb/G Bb/F  Cm
The ground is empty and cold  as  hell
       Fm        G             Cm
But we all go together when we go    ad lib fading
