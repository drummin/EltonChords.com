Well, your eyes just haven't been the same, Joseph
                                A     C#m
Are you bad at dealing with the fame, Joseph?
          B         A      E            B
There's a pale moonshine above you,
        E        C#m            A           B
Do you see both sides? Do they shove you around?
 
         E                        A     E
Is the touchstone forcing you to hide, Joseph?
                             A     C#m
Are the rumours eating you alive, Joseph?
         B    A          E        B
When the holy night is upon you,
         E          C#m          A         B
Will you do what's right, the position is yours?
 

          G      C           G         C
From the temple walls to the New York night,
    G          D         C
Our decisions rest on a child.
         G        C
When she took her stand,
        G          C
Did she hold your hand?
          G             D            C
Will your faith stand still or run away, 
      G
Run away?
 
E - A - E - A - C#m
 
              E             A
When they've driven you so far, 
           E
That you think you're gonna drop,
       E             A                  C#m
Do you wish you were back there at the carpenter shop?
         B             A
With the plane and the lathe, 
         E                B
The work never drove you mad.
         G#m         C#m
You're a maker, a creator, 
          A          B
Not just somebody's dad
 
          G      C            G        C
From the temple walls to the New York night,
       G       D         C
Our decisions rest on a man.
        G        C
When I take the stand,
         G       C
Will he hold my hand?
        G             D            C
Will my faith stand still or run away, 
      E
Run away?

         A
And the desert, 
       B                       E        C#m
It's a hell of a place to find heaven
A                        B                     C#m
Forty years lost in the wilderness looking for God
        A                         B
And you climb to the top of the mountain
                     E
Looking down on the city,
 B/Eb  F#        A
Where you were born
                                       B
All the years since you left gave you time to sit back and reflect

E       A       E            B
Better you than me, (better you than me)
E      A        E    B
Better you than me, yeah
         E    A         E                B          
When the holy night is upon you (Better you, better you)
       E         A              E          B        
Do you see both sides? Do they shove you around?
 E      A            E       B
Better you than me, Joseph,
       E                    A
Better you than me, (better you than me)
E                        A
Joseph, Joseph, Joseph, Joseph
     E
Than me, 
       B
Better you than me
E               A
Better you than me
       E            B
Better you, better you than me

           E
Well, your eyes just haven't been the same, Joseph
