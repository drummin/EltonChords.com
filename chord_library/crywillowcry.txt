Intro:  | Fmaj7 |  /  | Cm6/Eb |  /  | Dm |  /  | Asus4 |  /  | A7 |

Fmaj7                                            Em7
Underneath your branches I have spent so many hours

Gm7                                                      Bm7
Looking at the sky, wondering why the trees are towers

Em                       G/D            A/C#
The photos in my pocket are pictures of the past

Fmaj7/C                                       G/A               A
A slim reminder of the rain that's hidden in the grass

Chorus:

      A/C#   D             Bm                    F#m
And I can see, I can see the things I want to be

       C               Eb            C/G - G
And cry willow, cry willow, cry

       C               Eb            C/G - G
And cry willow, cry willow, cry

                  G                                                 D
Bend your branches and defy the cloudless sky

Fmaj7              Em7          Am - A7
And cry willow, cry willow, cry

Fmaj7                                                 Em7
Now I stand and watch the geese as they go South

Gm7                                            Bm7
Watch a while, willow as they fly o'er our house

Em                       G/D               A/C#
I understand now fully well, the words are in my mouth

Fmaj7/C                                           G/A             A
So put me on the goose's back and let us all fly South

Repeat Chorus

       C               Eb            C/G - G
And cry willow, cry willow, cry

Bend your branches and defy the cloudless sky
