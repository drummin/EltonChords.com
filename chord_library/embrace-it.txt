Embrace It
Elton John/ Bernie Taupin
from the “Lestat” musical (2005)

Eb - Bb/D - Cm7 - Bb - Eb/Bb - Bb  x2

 G
Where is the glory in the new me
 Cm
Where is the feeling of achievement
         D
In the shadows of the evening
  F					    C
Where is the satisfaction in your killing creed

 G
Who am I now, I don't know
         Cm
I must question my existence
      D
And deal with your persistence
       F			      C
That somehow in some way you set me free

      Eb                     Bb/D			 Cm                Bb
And I don't think that I can take another night of these instincts that I fight
     Cm             Bb              C       F/C
This overwhelming dread of feeling damned inside

Bb
Oh God help us, just look at you
         Dm                    G7
You're shrinking away from my point of view
  Cm
Showering me with your pious plane
     F
The gift that I give is exempt from shame

   Eb   Bb     D7
Embrace it, embrace it
 Gm
Make no mistake, these dismal traits
    Eb/G  G   Cm      C7           F
Are temporary ties to everlasting life
        Eb     Cm   Bb
Embrace it, embrace it

Eb - Bb/D - Cm7 - Bb - Eb/Bb - Bb

     G
You seek my trust after the lies
             Cm
But in this superficial splendor
     D
The decades will seem endless
              F                         C
Or will the drudgery of torment be my bride

      G
What lies are these of what you speak
             Cm
Are you so blinded by contrition
          D
That you sense in me ambitions
        F                          C
And a failure to practice what I preach

       Eb               Bb/D                        Cm            Bb
And I don't think I can take another night of your countenance in sight
     Cm           Bb                 C         F/C
The wilted flower act who shuns the vampire's bite

Bb
Oh God belp me, just look at you
   Dm                       G7
Striding through Hell with nothing to prove
    Cm
A glorious ghost on infinity's fuse
      F
Then if it's to be, tell me what I should do

repeat chorus

Bb
So God help us to see it through
        Dm                  G7
Two of Lucifer's angels are on the loose
    Cm
Oh merciful and majestic boy
      F
This gift I bestow was to be enjoyed

repeat chorus

F - Eb - Cm - Bb
