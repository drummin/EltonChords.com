I Could Never Fall in Love with Anybody Else 
Written by Reg Dwight (1967)

Am - E7		Am - E7

Am			    D		    E
People often say to me, why do you go with her
      Am				    E7
She's not the sort of girl we thought you'd choose
    Am				   D		    E
Well frankly I just don't know why myself I must admit
     Am					  E7
That she's the girl you wouldn't like to lose

    C  Em		Am       F 	 E
And I couldn't fall in love with anybody else
C  Em		    Am	     F	     E
I couldn't fall in love with anybody else

Am				 D		   E
Look into her face and you will see she's rather plain
  Am			      E7
I think that's unanimously agreed
    Am				       D		E
Her hair is wrong her nose is long but even though they are
Am			   E7
She means all the world to me

    C  Em		Am       F 	 E
And I couldn't fall in love with anybody else
C  Em		    Am	     F	     E
I couldn't fall in love with anybody else

Am			F
She isn't everything a girl should be
    Am      G	      E
But find me one that is
Am			F
She isn't everything a girl should be
     aM      G        E   E7
But find me one that is

Am - E7		Am - E7

People often say to me, why do you go with her
She's not the sort of girl we thought you'd choose
Well frankly I just don't know why myself I must admit
That she's the girl you wouldn't like to lose

repeat chorus
