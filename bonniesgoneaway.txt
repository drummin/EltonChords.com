Bonnie’s Gone Away

VERSE 1
Esus (intro)
    					     A
Bonnie bridged the gap too many times
           Esus
She didn't know what I was thinking
                                     A
She crossed too many bridges and she swam too many pools
  C#m                           Bm7        Esus
Before she realised just what a fool she'd been

CHORUS
F#
   Now Bonnie's gone away
   A#m                               C#maj7
Pretending she don't understand the things I say
          D#
Like 'the world's too square'
     G#
And 'you're not here and you're not there
  C#                    Fm
Before me in my eyes to torture me and tell no lies
F#                   D#m9
   Now Bonnie's gone away

VERSE 2
Esus (link)
 		           A
She plays with matches and gets burned
    Esus
Too many times, she'll never learn
                    A
That fire burns and water boils
    C#m                 Bm7               
And blows my mind in two
     Esus
What can I do?

[REPEAT CHORUS]

D           G            Asus      A          D
 Bring back, bring back, bring back Bonnie to me
D           G            Asus                    D
 Bring back, bring back, bring back my Bonnie to me
G                          Bm
   And your love is like a thistle with no thorns
G                  Bm
 No ins or outs or roundabouts
             D
Now Bonnie's gone away



VERSE 3
Esus (link)
                      A
Bonnie bridged the gap too many times
           Esus                     A
She didn't know what I was thinking
Esus                        A              C#m                                 
 She laughed instead of cried and when she told a lie she admitted
    Bm7                     Esus E
That she’d had her way with me

[REPEAT CHORUS]
